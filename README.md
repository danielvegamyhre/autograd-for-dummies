# autograd-for-dummies
A minimal autograd engine written from scratch using no libraries. Inspired heavily by Andrej Karpathy's [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd), but this supports matrix operations and has lots of comments explaining the math, concepts etc. along the way. 

Enjoy :)
